# Incident Remediation

|        | Language Used        | Behavior Displayed |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Novice** | <ol><li>"I'm not sure this is our issue" or "I am sure this is the issue; this is the fix that will correct 100% of occurrences."</li> <li>"Let's just file a ticket to track the issue."</li> | <ol><li>_Discussions of the incident are either guarded/blame avoiding or aggressive/blameful, i.e. on the extremes of the spectrum_</li> <li>_The team's remediation activities (or lack thereof) directly contribute to being caught in a "break-fix" cycle_</li> <li>_Issue severity/priority not entirely defined or always agreed upon; largely driven by individuals_</li></ol> |
| **Beginner** | <ol><li>"We need an action plan to address the process gaps."</li> <li>"I'm pretty sure we already fixed this?"</li></ol> | <ol><li>_To remediate an incident, more process, procedures, rules, and/or reviews are suggested/instituted_</li> <li>_So-called "low hanging fruit" may be fixed, but the fix (and its reasoning) are not documented or incorporated into team runbooks/checklists_</li></ol> | 
| **Competent** | <ol><li>"We need to look deeper than just this incident to really address this problem effectively."</li> <li>"This needs to be fixed before the next release and we need to document the fix in our standard incident response documents."</li></ol> | <ol><li>_The team's standard remediation strategy is centered on the automation of every process/task that is automatable and the removal/refactoring of processes/tasks that are not readily automatable_</li> <li>_Issues have an understood /priority and the team is given bandwidth to drive them to completion_</li> <li>_Large issues are remediated via an "all hands on-deck" approach_</li> <li>_Lesser issues are remediated via "get well" programs/initiatives_</li></ol> |
| **Proficient** | <ol><li>"What can we learn from this incident"</li> <li>"What other aspects of the system have we learned from this incident? And where can we improve, engage with other teams to improve, or make the organization aware they need to improve?"</li></ol> | <ol><li>_Completed issue remediation is valued by the organization and teams prioritize it over feature work_</li> <li>_Direct issue recurrence is infrequent_</li> <li>_The team has bandwidth to discuss, evaluate, design, and begin implementing system resiliency improvements as a central contributor to incident remediation_</li></ol> |
| **Advanced** | <ol><li>"While operating our system today, how did we actively create and sustain success?"</li> <li>"What has our success taught us about the system, its operations, and its operators? How can we leverage that knowledge and proficiency to help prevent this class of issue from recurring and address it more quickly and effectively next time it does?"</li></ol> | <ol><li>_The team does not conceive of incident remediation as a separate activity; remediation is culturally integrated into the operation of the system_</li> <li>_"Self-healing" and resilience are considered during the design stage for new systems and services; the organization does not rely on, nor consider a system/service production ready until it has a base-level of resilient properties and is demonstrated to integrate with the existing infrastructure that supports resilience (monitoring, alerting, auto-scaling, etc.)_</li> <li>_A process exists for the team to address follow on consequences of resolution actions_</li> <li>_The team actively tracks on-going issue remediation and takes ownership to implement the “complete” solution; the organization effectively prioritizes this work_</li></ol> |
