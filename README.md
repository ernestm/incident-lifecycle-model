# Extended Dreyfus Model for Incident Lifecycles

This model describes the life cycle of incidents in the context of large-scale technology infrastructure, beginning at detection and running through response, analysis, remediation, and finally prevention.

It is organized using the [Dreyfus Model of skill acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition). In this way, it is **not** intended to be prescriptive _or_ metrics-driven, but rather to describe language patterns and behaviors one would observe in oneself or others as they detect, react to, and remediate incidents.

Given this, it also possible that organizations may fall into different descriptive categories within the model, i.e. "'Expert' at 'detection'; and 'beginner' at 'remedation'," etc.

The model is based upon various _actual_ behaviors and language patterns observed in some of the largest technology companies in the world, including many of the "DevOps unicorns."

Pull requests to correct errors or update language and/or behavioral patterns are welcome!
